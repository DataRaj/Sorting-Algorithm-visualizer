## Overview

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a dynamic and intuitive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work, aiding in the comprehension of their efficiency and performance characteristics.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch sorting algorithms in real-time, helping you grasp their inner workings visually.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Customizable Array Size:** Adjust the size of the input array to see how algorithms handle different data sets.
- **Step-by-Step Playback:** Understand each step of the sorting process with a step-by-step playback feature.
